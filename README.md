🧠 Vision Transformer (ViT) & DETR Object Detection in Google Colab
This project demonstrates how to:

🔽 Download a pre-trained ViT model from Hugging Face.

🐱 Perform image classification using ViT.

📦 Detect multiple objects in images using DETR.

📤 Upload your own images to visualize bounding boxes.

💾 Export the model locally or to GitHub.
